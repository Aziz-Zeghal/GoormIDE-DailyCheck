# GoormIDE-DailyCheck

Small Python script with Selenium to make the daily check-in on GoormIDE.

GoormIDE is a platform to host containers for running code. It works with a credit system, and this code takes the daily free credits.

### Requirements
You need Selenium on Python, you can figure it out :)
